				<p>I'm an artist of some sorts. I like drawing and painting. Printing with ink makes drawing even fancier, and making the paper just takes it a step further. Mixed media let's me be even more expressive, I love visual imagery, so I do photography as well, and anything textile. What happens when you combine all of these mediums? No, not a collage, be a little more original. I like dolls and computers, and with my artistic skill set it gives me even more power over my interests. I'd say this website is an art piece in itself, and the dolls I create are sculptures of art.
